Hi everybody and welcome to my new post about compiling C++ code in Windows 10 using a standard Linux configuration.

To begin with, we setup a Windows 10 machine to compile and execute Linux C++ code compiled with CLang using "Bash on Ubuntu" (BAU) provided by Windows 10.

To setup BAU you can follow these instructions from Microsoft site: 

[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl]

BAU installed? Can you open your newly installed Ubuntu terminal? Very well, let's go on.

First of all we need to install CLang onto BAU. To know what "clang" packages are available in BAU, we can just type:

{% highlight bash %}
> clang
{% endhighlight %}

On my machine I get:

{% highlight bash %}
* clang-3.3
* clang-3.4
* clang-3.5
{% endhighlight %}

Let's go ahead and install version 3.5

{% highlight bash %}
> sudo apt-get install clang-3.5
{% endhighlight %}

If everything went just fine, you should now be able to launch a very simple clang command, like:

{% highlight bash %}
> clang-3.5 --help
{% endhighlight %}

and get something like this:

![CLang Help]({{ site.url }}/assets/HelpFile.jpg)

Now we can edit our first program in C++. We can just use our preferred editor, save to BAU user directory, and then compile using the Command Line. 

Let's try with a simple C++11 source code that computes the number of uppercase letters in a string:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char example[] = "Hello BAU World!";

    int nr_ucase = 0;
    for_each( example, example+sizeof(example), [&nr_ucase](char c)
    {
        if (isupper(c))
            nr_ucase++;
    });
    cout << nr_ucase << " uppercase letters in: " << example << endl;

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

(you can find other examples in my [cpp11learn] project on GitHub.)
