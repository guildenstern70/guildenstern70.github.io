Welcome to my new post about compiling C++ code in Windows 10 using a standard Linux configuration - without using a Linux partition or Docker.

To begin with, we setup a Windows 10 machine to compile and execute Linux C++ code compiled with CLang using "Bash on Ubuntu", also known as "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL) provided by Windows 10.

To setup WSL you can follow these instructions from Microsoft site: 

[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl]

WSL installed? Can you open your newly installed Ubuntu terminal? Very well, let's go on.

First of all we need to install CLang onto WSL. To know what "clang" packages are available in WSL, we can just type:

{% highlight bash %}
> clang
{% endhighlight %}

On my machine I get:

{% highlight bash %}
* clang-3.3
* clang-3.4
* clang-3.5
{% endhighlight %}

Let's go ahead and install version 3.5

{% highlight bash %}
> sudo apt-get install clang-3.5
{% endhighlight %}

If everything went just fine, you should now be able to launch a very simple clang command, like:

{% highlight bash %}
> clang-3.5 --help
{% endhighlight %}

and get something like this:

![CLang Help]({{ site.url }}/assets/HelpFile.jpg)

Now we can edit our first program in C++. We will just use our preferred editor on Windows and then compile using the WSL Command Line tool. 

Let's try with a simple C++11 source code that computes the number of uppercase letters in a string:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char example[] = "Hello WSL World!";

    int nr_ucase = 0;
    for_each( example, example+sizeof(example), [&nr_ucase](char c)
    {
        if (isupper(c))
            nr_ucase++;
    });
    cout << nr_ucase << " uppercase letters in: " << example << endl;

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

(you can find other C++11 examples in my [cpp11learn] project on GitHub.)

Open your favourite editor, I like [Visual Studio Code] so I'm using that. Copy and paste the code above, as shown below:

![Editing in Visual Studio Code]({{ site.url }}/assets/VSCodeCpp.jpg)

There is a big problem, now. *WSL is not built to allow interoperability with Windows*. This means that even if you save your code into the WSL User Home directory, which is located here:

{% highlight msdos %}
C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\lxss\home\[username]
{% endhighlight %}

you will not be able to see it in WSL (try it! Note that /lxss/ is a system, hidden directory.)

You can use the Powershell the get to view the directory contents

![Powershell Dir in WSL]({{ site.url }}/assets/BAUDir.jpg)

but any modification made by Windows inside that directory will not be available in WSL. ([Here] you will find an interesting article that explains everything about it.)

So, how can we solve the issue? The trick is to use a Windows folder to make the editing, and then mount this folder in WSL.

First of all, we create a new folder using Powershell, for instance:

{% highlight msdos %}
mkdir C:\temp\cppcode\uppercase
{% endhighlight %}

and then save our code with Visual Studio Code as:

{% highlight msdos %}
C:\temp\cppcode\uppercase\main.cpp
{% endhighlight %}

Any Windows directory is mounted by default in WSL:

{% highlight msdos %}
C:\ -> /mnt/c
D:\ -> /mnt/d
...
{% endhighlight %}

so we will find our file in WSL:

{% highlight bash %}
ls -al /mnt/c/Temp/cppcode/uppercase/main.cpp
{% endhighlight %}

We are finally ready to use our CLang compiler. Of course, in a real world project we will setup a CMake script in order to compile and link our source file(s), but for this small example it will be sufficient to launch:

{% highlight bash %}
cd /mnt/c/Temp/cppcode/uppercase/
clang++-3.5 main.cpp -o uppercase -std=c++11
{% endhighlight %}

and finally run the executable with

{% highlight bash %}
./uppercase
{% endhighlight %}
