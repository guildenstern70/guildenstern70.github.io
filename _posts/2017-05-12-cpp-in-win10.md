Hi everybody and welcome to my new post about compiling C++ code in Windows 10 using a standard Linux configuration.

To begin with, we setup a Windows 10 machine to compile and execute Linux C++ code compiled with CLang using "Bash on Ubuntu" (BAU) provided by Windows 10.

To setup BAU you can follow these instructions from Microsoft site: 

[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl]

First of all we need to install CLang onto BAU. To know what "clang" packages are available in BAU, we can just type:

{% highlight bash %}
> clang
{% endhighlight %}

On my machine I get:

{% highlight bash %}
* clang-3.3
* clang-3.4
* clang-3.5
{% endhighlight %}

Let's go ahead and install version 3.5

{% highlight bash %}
> sudo apt-get install clang 3.5
{% endhighlight %}
